# ATHLETIX INSIGHTS: HIGH ACCURACY STRATEGIC ANALYSIS FOR OLYMPIC COMPETITIONS

##### Athletix Insights is a data-driven platform designed to help athletes, coaches, and sports analysts optimize performance and strategy for Olympic competitions. Using historical Olympic datasets and advanced machine learning, the system provides predictive insights, performance trends, and actionable recommendations.

### Features :

1) Athlete Performance Trends: Analyze athlete performance over time to identify strengths and areas for improvement.</BR>

2) Event & Competition Statistics: Track medal counts, performance scores, and event-specific trends.</BR>

3) Medal Prediction: Predict the probability of winning a medal using machine learning classification models.</BR>

4) Performance Improvement Prediction: Estimate future performance scores with regression models.</BR>

5) Strategic Recommendations: Suggest personalized training and focus areas based on performance data.</BR>

6) Interactive Visualizations: Use dashboards to explore trends, statistics, and athlete analytics in real-time.</BR>

### Technologies Used

-  Python 3.x.</BR>
-  Pandas & NumPy for data processing.</BR>
-  Scikit-learn for machine learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier).</BR>
-  Plotly for interactive data visualization.</BR>
-  CSV for dataset storage.</BR>
